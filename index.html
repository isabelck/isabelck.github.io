				My fav Scalia marriage equality dissent moments: <br>
					<blockquote>“The nature of marriage is that, through its enduring bond, two persons together can find other freedoms, such as expression, intimacy, and spirituality. (Really? Who ever thought that intimacy and spirituality [whatever that means] were freedoms? And if intimacy is, one would think Freedom of Intimacy is abridged rather than expanded by marriage. Ask the nearest hippie. Expression, sure enough, is a freedom, but anyone in a long-lasting marriage will attest that that happy state constricts, rather than expands, what one can prudently say.)"</blockquote> 
					<p>How I imagine Scalia's marriage based on that quote: </p>
						<iframe width="854" height="510" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0tq7luLwp1I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br>
					<blockquote>"Not a single Southwesterner [is on the Supreme Court] or even, to tell the truth, a genuine Westerner (California does not count)." </blockquote>
					<p>Probably because of all those damn hippies out there.</p>

				In other ugh comedian news: Amy Schumer. So the Guardian published <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/28/amy-schumer-comedys-viral-queen">this</a> about Amy Schumer, saying (after lots of very positive things) "For such a keen observer of social norms and an effective satirist of the ways gender is complicated by them, Schumer has a shockingly large blind spot around race." I agree with what they're saying, her stand-up often is uncomfortable and problematic, many times about race and sexaul harassment. Many of her sketches fall flat for me to, like <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/d5z8a6/inside-amy-schumer-fight-like-a-girl---uncensored">this</a> one mentioned in the peice, which basically just "Girls are crazy and their boyfriends are victims of their crazy amirite??!" <a href="https://twitter.com/amyschumer/status/615182173570633728">Amy</a> then <a href="https://twitter.com/amyschumer/status/615568605292310528">responds</a>. Let us turn to Jay Smooth's analysis <iframe width="854" height="510" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RQXfxrNv3MI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>All our favs are problematic 😠.

				Pretty much my <a href="https://twitter.com/gaywonk/status/614200308571500544">thoughts</a> on the "heckler." <a href="http://transgenderlawcenter.org/archives/11723">Yep</a>.

				So I just listened to <a href="http://gimletmedia.com/episode/case-4-vanity-plate/">this</a> episode of Mystery Show (podcast on podcast startup Gimp from NPR contributor Starlee Kine), and this is weird right?? The show creeped me out a little when she was pestering celebrities (Britney Spears and Jake Gyllenhaal), but she literally found a cop to do shady shit so she could find some rando's home address and then went there multiple times until she got the lady to agree to talk to her. isabel.pizza professional opinion: this show seems less like mystery solving and more like "how to stalk someone until they agree to talk to you." Most damning evidence against the show: Starlee seemingly thanks Jon Ronson at the end of the show. Does she mean *that* Jon Ronson?? So I did a little Mystery solving of my own, checked the show transcript and there it is! <img src=""> If it is indeed <a href="https://twitter.com/manymanywords/status/587725537734430721">this</a> Jon <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/jacquishine/its-a-shame#.kaDRyAkrVm">Ronson</a>, then 😒
